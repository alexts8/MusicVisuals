# Description of the assignment
*Music Visualiser assignment OOP 2021-22*

For our assignment, we have developed a music visualiser using java's processing and minim libraries. It is a visual experience consisting of various visual elements that react to and synchronize with music (our song of choice being "Crystalised" by The xx), and some elements can be controlled by the user via the keyboard. There are (x number) of distinct "renders", which are essentially different screens of visual elements, and the user can change between these screens at their will via the keyboard.

Each visual element is kept in its own class, but use inheritance to access functions and variables from the base class.

We made an effort to keep the colours and visuals harmonious and aesthetically pleasing, and also to match well with the atmosphere of the music.


# Instructions
When the program is run, the user is met with a menu screen. They are directed to press 'g' to begin the visualiser. Upon pressing g, the song begins and the first visual of 5 total is displayed. These 5 visuals can be viewed at any time of the user's choosing, by pressing a key 1 through 5 on their keyboard.

Certain sketches have an added layer of interaction, as they can be conterolled via the 'wasd' keys on the keyboard. Visual 2 can be rotated clockwise or anticlockwise using a or d. The 3D element of Visual 3 can be rotated around the x or y axis in either direction by using the w, a, s or d keys. The user can switch between these visuals and continue to control them for the duration of the song.

# How it works

As mentioned previously, we developed 5 renders in total, and a menu which essentially constitutes a sixth. Each of these renders are stored in their own class. In each class, an instance of the main java file "visual" is created. This visual file extends another java file, "visuals", which contains useful methods for calculating thigs like amplitude and frequency bands. In doing this, we allowed ourselves to access these methods in each render class, and this was essentially how we created the visuals. Each of the renders' render methods are called in the class "visual" at the appropriate time (using a switch statement), to display them on the screen.

*The following is a brief explanation of each visual*

The first visual represents a guitar, and displays first upon beginning the visualiser. It contains 6 strings, created using processing's built in "bezier" function, which was researched. Using the getBands() function, we are able to make each of these beziers change shape, based on frequencies - each one "vibrates" - the parameters of the bezier function change -  when a frequency within their frequency band is detected. Using this, we can give the impression of realistic guitar strings that synchronize to the music, as each one vibrates independently, when certain frequencies are present.

The second visual contains a background of sin waves, that react to changes in amplitude using the getAmplitude() function. The centerpiece is made of a collection of shapes made using the "superformula" - a mathematical formula we researched, that creates interesting shapes using some of processing's mathematical functions. This shape also reacts to amplitude, and can be rotated via the keyboard, using processing's "rotate"

The third visual shows a lorenz attractor with a background of sine waves. Both the attractor and the waves react to the background music using the lerp function to obtain a lerped buffer. The lorenz attractor is based on a mathematical formula that continues to get larger and larger, similar to a butterfly effect. The attractor can also be rotated along the X and Y axis by pressing the w, a, s and d keys using processing's RotateX and RotateY functions. Both the attractor and waves have the same colour scheme that continously change.

The fourth visual contains a reactive flower model as well as four background rippling circles. The flower model is based on Vogel's formula to create a phyllotactic pattern. It also reacts to the music using a lerped buffer function. The background for this visual is four grey rippling-circles that blend together to create various different patterns when they collide. They are created using arrays in a for loop.

the Fifth visual showcases 9 distinct tiki masks changing periodically using an array of svg files. We are able to scale the images in accordance with the amplitude of the song. Between the two circuclar bands there are also contained rotating exotic flowers that change in number of petals each second. To create these  petals we utilised vogels formula, that changes its shape rapidly. The flowers are mapped in a circle to give it an even space. The colour scheme is also mapped from 0-225 to create vibrant colourful images. Around the tiki masks is a circuclar waveform using vertex that reacts with music captivating the change of intensity of the song. It also releases particles using pVectors that appear around the ring, and these particles' velocity accelerates by the high amplitudes of the song creating a star field effect and  mimicking the night sky.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
One thing we are particularly proud of after our completion of our assignment, is the cohesiveness of the visuals, in relation to the music. We believe that throughout the visualiser, the colours are harmonious and the atmosphere created by each visual coalesce well to form one larger visual experience. We are particularly proud of this, as it demonstrates good project management, and shows that despite the fact that we each created visuals seperately, we maintained a shared vision for what the final product should look and feel like - and we are very proud of the result.

Furthermore, we think our final product works very well with our song choice. We were certain to create visuals with the atmosphere of the song in mind, which led to visuals such as the guitar and the tiki masks. We believed from the beginning that the match between the atmosphere of the song and our visuals would be key in creating a more enjoyable overall experience, and we are very proud of how we adhered to this principle.

Good time management is key when completing an assignment, and we are proud of how we started working in a timely manner and the fact that we did not do need to rush any aspect of the assignment, as this would not only have led to more stress but also worsened the caliber of our project. 

We are also proud with the complexity of the code itself. Some of the mathematical formulas were very difficult to translate into java, and some methods from the processing library were not at all easy to get to grips with, but we are certainly pleased with how we managed to utilise them. Some of the principles of OOP such as polymorphism and subclassng felt unnatural and new to us, as they arent things we were necessarily used to applying prior to this project. However, our Object Oriented Programming skills were definitely ehnanced during the assignment, as we divided all our visuals into subclassses and made use of inheritance and polymorphism. It is definitely fair to say that our java skills improved on all fronts throughout our development of this project, and that is something to be proud of.

We worked as a team and utilizing different skills and knowledge to create this project, we brought together interesting ideas that we could all agree on. We were able to help each other in times of need and collaberated in a professional and friendly manner. We are proud to be able to learn something new by doing this project in areas such as mathematics and physics using processing as well as the different algorithms creating captivating visuals.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
